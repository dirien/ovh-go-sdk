### Motivation

An opinionated OVHCloud Go SDK based on github.com/ovh/go-ovh

### Why writing an own SDK? ü§î

The official go-ovh is a lightweight Go wrapper around the whole OVH APIs. I wanted to create an opinionated view on a
subset of features.

It is build, that it resembles the SDKs from other cloud-providers like DigitalOcean.
